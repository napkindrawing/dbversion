dbversion - Database versioning and deployment/migration management

Home:

    https://github.com/napkindrawing/dbversion

Purpose:

    Allows incremental upgrades to be applied to a database, and verifies that
    previous upgrades have been applied.

Usage:

    Database revisions are organized into profiles. A profile is simply the name
    of the directory containing the revisions.

    All revisions are stored as SQL files, one per version.

    All revisions have a version number, which is zero-padded and five digits long.

    Revision files are named in a standard convention consisting of the following
    items concatenated together

        1. Version Number
        2. The character "-" or "_"
        3. A textual name for the revision
        4. The characters ".sql"
    

Sample Project Layout:

    The following project has two profiles. One, "core", contains the core schema
    for the application, the other "sample_data" has testing data.

    sql/
        core/
            00001_schema.sql
            00002_data.sql
            00003_bugfix-user_name_length.sql
        sample_data/
            00001_users.sql
            00002_preferences.sql
